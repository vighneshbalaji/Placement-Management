# Placement-Management
The  project  is  aimed  at  developing  a  web  server  application  -  “INTERLINKING 
CAMPUS PLACEMENT IN HIGHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTE” for the college. 
The  system  is  an  application  that  can  be  accessed  and  effectively  used  throughout  the 
organization  with  proper  login  enabled.  This  system  can  be  used  as  an  application  by  the 
Placement  Officers  in  the  college  to  manage  the  student  information  with  regard  to 
placement. Student logging will be able to upload their personal and register placement drive 
with  CV  or  resume.  Our  project  provides  the  facility  of  maintaining  the  details  of  the 
students. It reduces the manual work and consumes less paper work to reduce the time. 
The system provides companies information and their recent aptitude material which 
helps the student to prepare for aptitude round.

The  System  provides  the  facility  of  viewing  both  the  personal  and  academic 
information of the student and company. The company can search for eligible students. Also 
the institute and administrator can insert and delete of records. Eligible students will receive 
an email including the details of the company, date, time and location of the interview will be 
provided automatically. 

The System provides an additional facility of cloud storage. Here the student can store 
their  educational  information  in  the  form  of  a  CV  or  resume  file  and  it  also  provide  to 
download the aptitude material and company profile by the student. This helps the student to 
prepare for their interview process easily. 

The  System  provides  the  facility  to  download  student  details  and  those  who  are 
eligible  for  the  specified  placement  drive,  those  who  are  registered  for  the  specified 
placement drive and those who are placed for the specified placement in form of PDF file by 
the institute. It helps placement officers to easily track and view student status.
